## Make Contribution

If you want to contribute to this project, fork the project first, and then clone the project and make changes on your own repository,

Once you pushed into your own repository, you may open a pull request.

## Local Development Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js 18+ and npm 10+ installed.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `npm ci`).
3. Use the npm scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`) to work locally.

> The project standardizes on npm; please avoid using Bun, pnpm, or yarn so that the single `package-lock.json` stays the source of truth.
