# Changelog

## 2025.11.14

- Added a Vitest-based test harness (jsdom environment, global setup, and 99% coverage gates) and expanded suites for stores, generators, and font utilities.
- Refactored generators to share logic via new composables, centralized font metadata/configuration, and improved selection persistence plus font-loading behavior.
- Cleaned up Vuetify imports, refreshed dependencies, and tuned the Vite build for compressed outputs.
- Adopted Biome for consistent formatting/linting, standardized project styles, and committed a Bun lockfile for deterministic installs.
- Introduced GitHub Actions CI driven by Bun to run install, lint, test, and build steps on every push/PR.
